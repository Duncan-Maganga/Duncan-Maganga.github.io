##  Phishing Simulation with Gophish.  

This project demonstrates how phishing simulations can be used to test and improve organizational security awareness. Using the Gophish framework, I designed and deployed a phishing campaign that mimicked real world attacks, complete with custom email templates and a fake login page.  


The project shows how easily attackers can trick users into revealing credentials and why continuous training, awareness, and monitoring are critical in todayâ€™s digital world. By running controlled simulations, organizations can:    


- Measure human risk (who clicks, who reports).  
- Build a culture of awareness where employees think twice before clicking suspicious links.  
- Strengthen incident response by training staff to report phishing quickly.  
- Support compliance efforts through documented awareness programs.  


In an era where 90% of cyberattacks start with phishing, this project highlights how simulation exercises are a powerful defense tool.
