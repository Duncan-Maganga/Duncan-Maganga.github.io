# Web Application Vulnerability Assessment Report

## About the Project:   

This project focused on assessing the security of a deliberately vulnerable web application (DVWA) to simulate how real attackers exploit weaknesses in web applications.  


## Purpose:  

To identify common vulnerabilities, understand their potential business impact, and recommend effective mitigations that strengthen web application security.  


## Methodology:  

- I Set up DVWA in a controlled lab environment.  
- Used OWASP ZAP, SQLMap, Nikto, and manual testing to identify flaws.  
- Exploited vulnerabilities including SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Clickjacking.    
- Mapped findings to the OWASP Top 10 for industry relevance.  

## Impact for Modern Business:  

This project demonstrated how easily attackers can exploit poorly secured applications, but also how proper mitigations (input validation, prepared statements, CSP, secure headers) can:  

- Protect sensitive customer and business data.  
- Ensure compliance with regulations like GDPR, and HIPAA.  
- Prevent fraud, downtime, and reputational loss of the company.  
- Build stronger customer trust by showing commitment to security of there data.
