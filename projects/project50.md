# Education Management Policy.  


## Purpose. 


Our Cybersecurity Education Policy aims to establish a comprehensive framework for
promoting a culture of cybersecurity awareness, knowledge, and responsible behavior
throughout our organization. This policy aims to provide guidelines and procedures for
developing, implementing, and continuously improving cybersecurity education and
awareness programs that empower our employees to recognize, prevent, and respond
to potential cyber threats. By prioritizing education and awareness, this policy seeks to
enhance the overall security posture of our organization, reduce the likelihood of human
error leading to security incidents, and foster a sense of shared responsibility for
protecting our systems, data, and networks. Through regular training, communication,
and engagement initiatives, we strive to cultivate a vigilant and resilient workforce
equipped to safeguard our sensitive information and assets in the face of evolving
cybersecurity risks.
